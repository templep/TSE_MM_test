# TSE_MM_test
a companion repository with the TSE submission


For each case study, we provide a data folder, a script folder and a result folder.
Paths in scripts may not be up-to-date but they may be freely modified in scripts (simply commenting the corresponding line or by modifying it directly).

Scripts are written in Scilab (an open source software similar to Matlab).
